<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![MineBox Preview][product-screenshot]](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Veycade/MineBox/main/preview.png)

MineBox was designed and created to help people make minecraft servers with ease. The problem we encountered was that most users don't know how to edit their servers or easily change things. Everything is easily changeable with MineBox. MineBox also has more advanced features for more advanced users such as console logging, server monitoring and many more features to come.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

1. Head over to our <a href="https://github.com/Veycade/MineBox/releases">Releases</a> page and download the latest version of MineBox.

2. Run the installer for MineBox ⚠️READ NOTE BELOW⚠️
   
- ⚠️NOTE:⚠️ 
  - It is recommended to change the default installation folder of minebox or you may not be able to find where your servers are.
  - Change the installation folder to somwhere you will remember and be able to access ( Preferably to your desktop )
  - Minebox automatically creates a folder in the installation directory that you selected called "MineBox" so you dont need to worry about getting a cluttered desktop.

3. MineBox will now be installed on your computer and should automatically open if you checked the "Run Minebox" checkbox. If Minebox is not open then run MineBox.

4. You can now create servers in the "SERVERS" tab and monitor them.
